# Ryan Bennek

Hey, I'm a Senior Support Engineer at [Mediavine](https://www.mediavine.com/). I enjoy centering a div, spending time in my kitchen, petting my dogs, and tinkering with just about anything I can get my hands on.

I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Advertising - obviously, I'm putting that to good use. I'm a self taught, tutorial watching, son-of-a-gun who isn't very good at this (yet), but doesn't let that stop him from trying. My partner calls me webmaster - I love her very much.

I've learned enough JavaScript to get me this far. If you're reading this, I've learned enough React to get me _THIS_ far. Maybe in the future I'll know enough Typescript to do more than just answer practice 'what type is this' type questions. The sky is the limit.

If you've made it this far, stop by and check out some of the Projects (If you're here before there's any projects, marvel at how nice this text currently looks on your phone).

If you'd like to say hi, you can send me internet mail at rbennek@proton.me ðŸ‘‹
