## Hey There! 

If you're reading this, welcome! As I've grown as a web developer, I've found an increasing itch to write about what I'm doing. Instead of opting for a more traditioal WordPress or Medium blog, I thought I should leverage my skills as a web developer to make my own. 

This project is very small in scale - all posts are written in markdown, and directly uploaded to the repo.

# A NextJS Portfolio 

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio. 

- Automatically configured to handle Markdown/MDX
- Generates an RSS feed based on your posts
- A beautiful theme included out of the box
- Easily categorize posts with tags
- Fast, optimized web font loading

This was the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
